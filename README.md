# Minesweeper 2.0

**By Devon A. Fazekas**

A spinoff of the classical Minesweeper game. Drawn with ASCII characters within the console window, the user navigates the grid using the arrow-keys and makes selections with ENTER. Not unlike the original, the user must uncover all the zones while avoiding the bombs. However, the game does not end when a bomb is hit, instead, the user loses 50% of their earned points, whereas each successful guess earns only 5-points.

## Objective

Finish the game with the most amount of points earned by successfully selecting bomb-free zones. Beware, each unsuccessful guess steals half your points.
