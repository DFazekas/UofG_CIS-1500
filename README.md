This program will read as input the length and width of a rectangle (entered by user) as integers. It will then output the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

For example, if the length and width were 15 and 4 respectively, then your program should output:

```
The area of the rectangle is 15 x 4 = 60.
The perimeter of the rectangle is equal to (2 x 15) + (2 x 4) = 38.
```
