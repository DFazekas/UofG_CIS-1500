	printf("    DDD          DDD    ee       ee         vv       vv       ");
	printf("    DDD          DDD    eeeeeeeeeeee         vv     vv        ");
	printf("    DDD        DDD       ee                   vv   vv         ");
	printf("    DDD      DDD          eee                  v  vv          ");
	printf("    DDDDDDDDD               eeeeee              vv            ");
 
6. [8 marks] You are designing a new online census. As part of the interface, you wish to display how old the user is in terms of both years and months. 
For example, if the current day is Jan 25, 2011 and the user is born on Jan 26, 2001, then you want to display: 
"You are 9 years old and have been alive for 119 months". But currently you do not have any information about the user. How can you get and display this information?
(a) What are the inputs and outputs required in this problem?
	int CurrentYear, CurrentMonth, CurrentDay;
	int BirthYear, BirthMonth, BirthDay;
	int YearsLived, MonthsLived, DaysLived;
    
(b) What are the subproblems that should be considered when designing an algorithm?
	(1) The values of the day/month/year need to be handled individually, rather than one lump sum integer; each variable has varying limitations that must be handled uniquely.
		- Days must be between 1 & 31; Months between 1 & 21, and years must at least be positive (minimum value is optional).
	(2) Types of input; anticipate and prepare to handle invalid inputs; too few/many digits, non-numeric, etc.
		- Loop questions until appropriate values are obtained, then carry on.
	(3) The differences between the years (Current & Birth) may incorrectly evaluate to zero when equal, despite BirthMonths surpassing CurrentMonths, or BirthDays overlapping CurrentDays.
		- The difference in the years 2011 and 2001 may evaluate to 10 years, thus differences in months and days must be taken into consideration, so that it evaluates to 9 instead. 
	(4) 

(c) Design an algorithm (pseudocode) for this problem.
	- Declare and initialize all necessary values (BirthYear, CurrentDay, MonthsLived, etc.).
	- Begin question-loops, stopping upon valid input.
	- Prompt user for today's date (MM,DD,YYYY).
	- Scan each input separately.
	- If INVALID (DAY < 1 or DAY > 31, or MONTH > 12, etc.), repeat.
	- Otherwise, prompt user for their birthdates.
	- Scan each input separately.
	- If INVALID (BirthYear > CurrentYear), repeat.
	- Otherwise, proceed to calculations.
	- If 

7. [10 marks] Write a C program to compute the area and perimeter of a rectangle. You should prompt the user to enter two integers: the length and the width. 
The output should be formatted exactly as follows given the user inputs a length of 15 and width of 4:
The area of the rectangle is 15 x 4 = 60.
The perimeter of the rectangle is equal to (2 x 15) + (2 x 4) = 38.
